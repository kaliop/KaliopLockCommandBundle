## Usage

### Command locker

This bundle gives the possibility to "lock" console commands in order to prevent concurrent execution.

In order to do so, you have to declare your command as a service and tag it with `lock: true`

```yml
services:
    test.console.command:
        class: AppBundle\Command\TestLockCommand
        tags:
            - { name: "console.command", lock: true }
```

As you can see, the `console.command` tag has available a new lock option, which can be set to either `true` or `false`.
Commands registered with the lock option set to `true` will be locked at the command start event and unlocked at the command terminate or exception event.

Additionally, if needed, you can pass a `--no-lock` option on the command line when launching a command if you don't want the command to be locked for a single execution:

```bash
$ php bin/console kaliop:command:example --no-lock
```
